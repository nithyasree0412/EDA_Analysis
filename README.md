Introduction :
Heart disease remains one of the leading causes of death worldwide, making early detection and prediction essential for improving patient outcomes. 
Among various predictive modeling techniques, decision tree analysis stands out due to its simplicity and interpretability. 
This document explores the methodology, implementation, and results of using decision tree analysis to predict heart disease.
Methodology
Data Collection and Preprocessing
The prediction model was built using a dataset that includes various features relevant to heart disease,
such as age, gender, blood pressure, cholesterol levels, and other health indicators. Data preprocessing steps included handling missing values,
normalizing features, and splitting the data into training and testing sets to ensure robust model evaluation.

Decision Tree Analysis
Decision tree analysis is a non-parametric supervised learning method used for classification and regression.
It works by splitting the data into subsets based on the value of input features.
